As I have written before, the only way readers are going to get any of this wine is to be on the mailing list or check out one of the few restaurants that receives an allocation. This is an amazing operation on the hillsides overlooking the huge Dominus/Napanook estate. A complex set of caves and a remarkable, nearly surreal chateau grace the property. Winemaker Helen Turley, working with her viticulturalist husband, John Wetlaufer, is fashioning some spectacular wines from these hillsides of volcanic ash and basalt. These are big, structured, potentially long-lived wines that will need some cellar time for those lucky enough to latch onto a few bottles.

A second sorting of the must removes any remaining leaves or pieces of broken stems. The must is allowed to ‘cold soak' for three to five days prior to the onset of natural fermentation. Depending on the age of the vineyard and quality of the tannins, macerations may vary from one to three weeks. Rubicon is fermented in wooden Taransaud open-top tanks which hold the natural warmth of the fermentation longer into the maceration. This allows the new wine to stabilize color and increase the mouthfeel of the new wine. Both traditional punch-downs (early stages of fermentation) and pump-overs are used, resulting in ultra-dense, coating and supple tannins. \"},\n",

       "  'notes': 'We were unaware at that time that we were harvesting one of the greatest vintages of the late 20th century. The grapes had rarely, perhaps never, been as concentrated, particularly the Cabernets. In certain cases we surpassed the already historic levels of the 1986 and 1995 vintages, with an elegance and softness on the palate, reminiscent also of the 1990 and 1996 vintages. It seemed in fact that 2000 was setting a new benchmark in quality, never before attained, at least in terms of style. Throughout the barrel ageing time, these first impressions were gradually confirmed. The wine has now acquired a slightly tighter texture and at the same time keeps such a soft and especially long finish that it seems to go on forever… The bottling took place in November 2002, after over 2 years of barrel ageing. Such a long ageing is unusual but not as rare as one might think: most of the greatest vintages are aged for that length of time. (May 2010)'},\n",

We celebrated the bicentenary of the Estate’s buildings dating from 1815, and the inauguration of the new facilities, designed or reorganised, by Norman Foster. It is easy to imagine how much we dreamed that 2015 would be a great vintage! Without doubt, some of the result is owed to decisions made at the time of blending; only 35% of the harvest went into the first wine, which was a record of severity for a vintage of this standard. As usual, it was the Cabernet Sauvignon in first place with 87% of the blend; in addition to its concentration and finesse, this year it has an unusual vigour and strength. The Merlot has nothing to be ashamed of, at least in the great plots; it makes up 8% of the first wine. Cabernet Franc (3%) and Petit Verdot (2%) also find their place in this elitist blend, which confirms that, enable all grape varieties to express their own propensity. How can we compare 2015 to its predecessors? It is a thankless task, and a little futile, particularly for the great vintages. There are, of course, similarities, affinities, and also some differences where we do not expect to find them… But we can evoke a combination of the strength of 2005, the flesh of 2009, the subtlety of 2010, and the inimitable charm of Château Margaux.

Notions of menthol, scorched rocks, mocha, black cherries, cassis, chocolate, and espresso are found in this terrific offering. It will be developed and forward upon release, but will last for 12-15 years.    Winemaker and part owner, John Kongsgaard, produces these wines in partnership with auctioneer, Fritz Hatton. They are all fashioned from fruit grown in the \"H Block\" of the Hudson Vineyard, the highest point on that large ranch. The vineyard is planted in white volcanic ash-dominated soils. The Cabernet Franc/Merlot blend is the Arietta and the Syrah/Merlot blend is named Variation One. These striking offerings have a European sensitivity for elegance, structure, and delineation, but are clearly products of California, as evidenced by their prodigious ripeness as well as intensity.

Although rich and powerful at 14.4%  the early picking of the Merlot helped to preserve freshness, purity and tension. The slower ripening of the Cabernet helped the grapes to reach ideal phenolic maturity. This is reflected in the wines which have a remarkable tannic presence. This vintage combines freshness and complexity, power and precision, balance and density. Aromatic complexity dominates from the first nose and this wine expresses the elegance brought to it by optimal weather conditions. The significant proportion of Merlot brings particularly intense aromas of red and black fruit. The impressive nose is pure and precise with notes of raspberry, cherry, blackberry and blackcurrant embalmed in balsamic and subtle sweet aromas of pastries. The generosity and complexity of the nose dominate. Clean, pure and precise, this wine is lush and juicy reflecting perfectly the traits of the fresh fruit when it is tasted directly in the vineyard. A full, attractive attack is redolent of the Merlot of this vintage which is unctuous, round and mouth filling. The Cabernet Franc lends a lovely freshness to the mid-palate and gives the wine length on the finish. This wine is both dense and powerful whilst at the same time soft, unctuous and round.

He'd tasted fruit from Cappella in the 70s. He knew what kind of wine it could make. But that first replant was ill-fated thanks to diseased rootstock, and once again he was ripping out vines. “It took us six years before we had a crop. We could have ignored it, pulled the vines out one by one as they collapsed. But then we'd have all these different ripening patterns, which would impact consistency. It was an easy decision.”\"},\n",

It can never disavow its origins as we find all the complexity that is so well known for characterizing Haut-Brion: its notes of smoke, of cigar and roasted coffee grains. The whiff of fresh fruit is also present: currants and cherries. From the first approach this wine startles one with its density. It is long in the mouth plus creamy, big, powerful and fresh. It takes a hold of you and penetrates your senses. Power and harmony are the distinctive traits of this vintage. The aromatic persistence is incredibly long. This perfectly balanced wine will without a doubt become one of the biggest successes of our Domaine.'},\n",

They give to the grenache grape a very special expression, very refined and precise. The lieu-dit \"Hominis Fides\" was planted before 1902. It doesn\\'t change much: it is a respectable age anyway. This vine has the ability to compensate the excesses of the vintages: it beautifully regulates itself. In a hot year, it will balance the alcohol with a very good physiological ripening. In a cool year, it will ripe quicker than the other vines. '},\n",

It is full-bodied, viscous, with an inky richness and thickness, but terrific acidity and rather high tannins. I can\\'t see this wine being ready to drink before another 6-7 years of bottle age, but it should keep for 20+ years.

Each blend has been half Merlot and half Cabernet but no two wines have hadthe same vineyard combination.

It was wonderful to vinify Valbelle this year because all the characteristic aromas of Valbelle could be found by smelling the vat fermenting, from the stage they develop to the time they marry to get the homogeneity. The 2010 vintage has aromas and flavors of wild raspberry, white pepper, graphite, and laurel.  This bottle will have to be kept. '},\n",

Bright, airy and deep, it delights us with a lush appearance in which clear violet notes on a ruby background can be distinguished. The wine initially evokes notes of red fruits on a well defined floral background. Rose and violet notes quickly appear. These are surrounded by increasing complexity in which cocoa and cassis are clearly distinguished. Gradually, as it aerates, the wine's aroma expands and characteristic notes of orange blossom appear. In the month it is opulent and very unctuous.

Its secondary aromas show some development and include a bouquet of bacon, game meats, leather, violets, and cedar. The palate offers pleasure with a delicious attack of sweet blackcurrant and licorice spice. Oak characters are well integrated with some background flavors of vanilla, toffee, mocha, and cinnamon. Some tasters noted a green or vegetal aspect to the wine with descriptors including thyme and green tomato. Earth characteristics ranged from iron-rich and compost to graphite. Most considered this wine to be youthful, with its high concentration of tannins, full body and fairly high levels of acidity. It seemed a difficult wine to grade because of the level of competition, almost every taster offered a tasting window from 2012 onwards.'}]"
